        <section id="who-we-are">
          <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
          <p>
            Axcended is a South African learning and mentorship platform that
            connects high-school and university learners with tutors, mentors,
            classes, games, study groups and other educational content.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we say “Axcended”, “we”, or “us” in this policy, we are referring
            to the team that designs, builds and operates the Axcended app and
            website.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- 2. Information we collect -->
        <section id="data-we-collect">
          <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>

          <h3>2.1 Information you give to us</h3>
          <p>We collect information you provide directly when you use Axcended, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Account details</strong> – your name, email address, password, and basic profile information such as grade, school, university or study interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Tutor / mentor profile details</strong> – if you sign up as a tutor or mentor, we may collect extra information such as subjects you teach, short bio, qualifications and links you choose to share.</li>
            <li><strong>Content and activity</strong> – messages, posts, comments, homework uploads, session notes, answers in quizzes and games, and any files you choose to upload.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription and payment information</strong> – the type of plan you choose, purchase history, renewal status and transaction IDs. Payments are processed by Google Play or other payment providers; we do not store your full card details.</li>
            <li><strong>Support requests</strong> – information you send us when you contact support (for example screenshots, crash descriptions or feedback).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2.2 Information we collect automatically (usage data)</h3>
          <p>
            When you use the app or website, we automatically collect some information
            about how it is used so we can keep Axcended secure and improve the
            experience. This may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Device information (device model, operating system, app version, language).</li>
            <li>IP address and approximate location (e.g. country or region), mainly to keep the platform safe and prevent abuse.</li>
            <li>Pages and screens you view, buttons you tap, time spent in different sections, and general usage patterns.</li>
            <li>Crash logs and diagnostic information that help us fix bugs and improve performance.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2.3 Information from third-party sign-in</h3>
          <p>
            If you choose to sign in with Google, Apple, Facebook or other
            providers, we receive basic profile information from that service
            (such as your name, email address and a unique identifier), according
            to the permissions you grant there.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- 3. How we use your information -->
        <section id="how-we-use">
          <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
          <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Let you create and manage your Axcended account and profile.</li>
            <li>Match students with tutors, mentors, classes, groups and challenges.</li>
            <li>Run learning features – including lessons, quizzes, games, progress tracking and other tools inside the app.</li>
            <li>Process subscriptions and in-app purchases, and show you the correct access, plans and wallets inside the app.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you about updates, class reminders, notifications, security alerts and important changes to Axcended.</li>
            <li>Analyse usage so we can understand what is working, fix issues and build better features for students and tutors.</li>
            <li>Protect the Axcended community by detecting spam, abuse, cheating and security risks.</li>
            <li>Comply with our legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If we introduce AI-powered features (for example automatic marking or
            study recommendations), we will clearly explain how those features use
            your content and results inside the app.

          </p>

          <h3>Types of cookies we use</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential cookies</strong> — required to keep you logged in and secure and to run core features of the website.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference cookies</strong> — remember things like language or display settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics cookies</strong> — help us understand how people discover and use Axcended so we can improve it.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing cookies</strong> — may be used to promote Axcended on other platforms and measure campaign performance.</li>

        <section id="sharing">
          <h2>5. How we share your information</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell your personal data. We share information only when it
            is needed to run Axcended or when we are legally required to. This may
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Service providers</strong> who host our servers, send emails and notifications, provide analytics and crash reporting, or process payments on our behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Tutors, mentors and learners</strong> – your name and profile information may be visible to people you connect with in classes, groups or sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>App stores and payment providers</strong> – such as Google Play Billing, to manage purchases and subscriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal and safety</strong> – when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law, respond to a lawful request, or protect the rights, property and safety of Axcended, our users or others.</li>
            <li><strong>Business changes</strong> – if we ever participate in a merger, acquisition or similar event, your information may be transferred as part of that process, but this Privacy Policy will continue to apply unless you are told otherwise.</li>

            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you decide that Axcended is no longer for you, you can request

          <ul>
            <li>We delete or anonymise the personal data we no longer need.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            You can request account deletion from within the app (where the
